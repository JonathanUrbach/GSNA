# GSNA 0.1.2
* This version is the resubmission version to CRAN.
* Fixes three main NOTE issues:
  1. Use of .plt instead of .plt.leg for make1ColorLegend() and make2ColorLegend()
  2. The 'lost braces' problem.
  3. Excessive package size, due largely to the use of SVG format in the vignette graphics. PNGs are used instead.
* There remain some additional NOTES, generated by devtools::check_rhub(), but they may not be important.
* Additional fixes.
  + Fixed a bug in scoreLFMatrix_C() that hardcoded e_precision = 12. It now works properly.
  + Fixed a bug in gsnPlotNetwork() & gsnHierarchicalDendrogram() that prevented proper rendering of PNG format outputs.

# GSNA 0.1.1
* This is (hopefully) the first public CRAN release version.

# GSNA 0.1.0

* This is the development version prior to CRAN submission.
