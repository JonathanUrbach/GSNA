Description: Functions for performing Gene Set Networking Analysis (GSNA) and visualizing the results.
  It is designed to work in tandem with standard pathways analysis methods, such as CERNO, GSEA and
  others, for simplifying such data sets by grouping together related functions on the basis of shared
  genes. Inputs to GSNA are the outputs of pathways analysis methods: a list of gene sets, modules,
  pathways or GO-terms with associated p-values. Since these pathways analysis methods may be used to
  analyze many different types of data including transcriptomic, epigenetic, and high-throughput screen
  data sets, the GSNA pipeline is useful for analyzing these data as well.
