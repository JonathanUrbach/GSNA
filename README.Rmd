GSNA stands for **G**ene **S**et **N**etwork **A**nalysis. GSNA is a toolkit for assessing the similarity of gene sets based on metrics of similarity and distance such as the Jaccard and Szymkiewiczâ€“Simpson overlap indices, and log Fisher *p*-values. The intended purpose of the GSNA package is to provide a set of ancillary methods to pathways analysis such as **GSEA** (@subramanian_gene_2005,@mootha_pgc-1-responsive_2003), and **CERNO** (@zyla_gene_2019). GSNA can be used subsequent to pathways analysis methods that generate lists of gene sets with associated significance statistics, e.g. *p*-values. From such data, groups of similar pathways can be inferred, greatly simplifying the task of analyzing complex pathways datasets. On the basis of similarity, networks and clusters (or subnets) can be generated and represented graphically, and statistical parameters can be assessed.



## Installation  

We intend to make the **GSNA** package available on CRAN in the near future. However, if you have the **devtools** package installed, you can install the development version of GSNA directly from GitHub like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github( repo = "https://github.com/JonathanUrbach/GSNA" )
```

Note: Currently, this method omits installation of the package's Roxygen2 man pages.  

If you have downloaded the source code from GitHub and opened the project in an Rstudio session, the following command can be used to install the package, including documentation:  

``` r
devtools::install( build_vignettes = TRUE, args = "--no-multiarch --with-keep.source" )
```


## Loading GSNA and Accessing Documentation    

To load GSNA, type the following in your R console:  

``` r 
library( GSNA )
```


To access a vignette containing additional information and usage examples, run:

``` r
vignette( "using_the_gsna_package" )
```

A package description and a list of function documentation can be obtained via:

``` r
help( package = "GSNA" )
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GSNA)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
